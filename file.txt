+## Philosophy
 +
  I hate coding absolute paths in my build script and I hate including
  built files as part of the base project. My philosophy is that the
  *environment* should be set up so that the tool can easily find the
 -external resources they need (JUnit, etc.) from the system, not within
 -the project. It's the system or dependency manager that provides the
 -libraries. Anyone who has the proper development environment set up --
 -one that works across many projects -- should be able to clone the
 -repository and do a build simply by running the build program with no
 -special arguments. There should be no need to edit or install anything
 -into the project space for the initial build.
